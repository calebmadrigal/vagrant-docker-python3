vagrant-docker-python3.4
========================

WARNING: This works wonderfully except for the minor issue of data not being saved :) This issue should soon be resolved by [boot2docker pull #534](https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/pull/534) (and its propogation to Vagrant's boot2docker image).

Python 3.4 isolated development environment using Docker in Vagrant.
